# Python for combinatorics
This repository contains Python code that is relevant for the [MAS334 Combinatorics](https://strickland1.org/courses/MAS334) module at the University of Sheffield.  Most of the code was originally written in Maple and/or Javascript.  I have translated most of it into Python, because that is the primary language that we teach to undergraduates in Sheffield.  The corresponding Javascript code can be found in the [combinatorics diagrams](https://github.com/NeilStrickland/combinatorics_diagrams) repository.
