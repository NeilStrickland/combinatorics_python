# Python for combinatorics
This repository contains Python code that is relevant for the [MPS352 Combinatorics](https://strickland1.org/courses/MPS352) module at the University of Sheffield.  Most of the code was originally written in Maple and/or Javascript.  I have translated most of it into Python, because that is the primary language that we teach to undergraduates in Sheffield.  The corresponding Javascript code can be found in the [combinatorics diagrams](https://github.com/NeilStrickland/combinatorics_diagrams) repository.

The main code is in the `.py` files.  The Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) import the `.py` files and then work through the examples in the notes (but of course you can modify them to do other calculations).  If you took MAS2008 then you should already have your computer set up so that you can use these notebooks.  If not, you can follow the instructions (under *Setting up the environment*) at https://strickland1.org/courses/MPS224/.  

To download all the files in this repository, click the green `Code` button near the top of the page https://github.com/NeilStrickland/combinatorics_python.  You can then either download a zip file (easiest) or clone the repository (which has some advantages, if you know what you are doing).
